                        <li> Goals address more general, societal, community, or institutional concerns. In developing a language curriculum, issues concerning language planning and policy must be taken into account since it is the society or broader community which the program serves that fundamentally determines the goals to be manifested in the course. In an ideal situation, thus, goals are determined by carefully examining information about the patterns of language use within the various domains of the society, as well as by studying</li>

Objectives, in turn, are specific outcomes or products of courses which are outlined in a syllabus. Objectives guide teachers; they also help learners understand where the course is going and why. Objectives can be expressed in terms of proficiency scores, or as performance objectives such as language skill attainments. Setting objectives in the course plans makes it possible to carry out</li>
                        <li> the necessary evaluation measures. It also makes it possible to specify the various levels of instruction within a program.

In answering this question, you will articulate course aims and objectives that will guide your choice of topics and your sequence of assignments.</li>
